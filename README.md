# Description
Archive of Raymond F. Peat's articles and newsletters with the associated references.

**Structure**

Each article/newsletter has its own folder, where the references are named in order of appearance.
- Duplicate references in the same article are skipped 
- Folders starting with the letter 'x' have only been through the first phase
- Folders starting with the letter 'y' have no reference section but they might have references in the text

**Development Phases**

The development is split into 3 phases
- Adding references found through sci-hub (https://sci-hub.st/).
- Adding references requiring to search old publications through Annas-Archive (https://annas-archive.org/)
- Adding references not found on sci-hub and annas-archive
