"neutral electrons," forming a "neutrino sea."

- DeBroglie (1959), Bohm (1959), and Dudley (1971) are among those who have more recently
proposed a need for a "sub-quantic" medium

(Nov., 1972) when he postulated that

13 When Dror Sadeh's experiments were reported, showing, for example, a "red-
shift" between locations on the east coast of the U.S., it seemed pretty obvious that either "time"
(cesium clocks) or

16 icke's (1957) observation that the red-shift (that is conventionally
interpreted as a Doppler shift connected with the speed of receding stars) can be interpreted in a
different way:

18 Kozyrev's basic assumption is that time is a source of neg-entropy. He claims that “events,” causal
sequences, set through "time" to modify other events is the vicinity (1968)

plays dice”

science, against the neo-Kantian view of orthodox physicists (such as Max Born

(the structuralists).


22 Neo-Kantianism was flourishing in Germany at the beginning of this century (e.g., Hermann Cohen
and Ernst Cassirer).
